            <h2 class="titleText"> YOUNG LANDLORD SCHEME</h2>
            <p class="title-text">
               <p> The Young Landlord Scheme, also known as the Smart Landlord scheme, is an innovative program designed to empower children at the early stages of their lives and secure their futures. The importance of education cannot be overstated, and many parents make significant sacrifices to ensure that their children receive a good education. However, the high cost of private schools and the reality of double-digit unemployment rates have made it increasingly difficult for families to secure a comfortable future for their children.

                One solution to this problem is to invest in something that has the capacity to appreciate as the child grows. For example, a child whose parents buy a plot of land today at N500,000 at a 0.5% rate of appreciation will be worth N20,000,000 in the next ten years. This is a significant return on investment that can greatly improve the child’s future prospects.
                
                The Smart Landlord scheme addresses the security of the future of children, eliminating the struggle and providing them with a more comfortable life in the long run. It is important to remember that land is a finite resource, and as such, its value will only appreciate over time. All of our derivatives are open for this scheme, and parents can buy with the name of their children. Their passport will be on the form with their names and their parents as next of kin.
                
                In addition to this, we have a smaller plot size option where parents can pay in installments over a longer duration. This flexibility in payment allows every parent the opportunity to turn their children into smart landlords, regardless of their financial situation. It is important for parents to remember that the locations that are considered expensive today were once very cheap. Most of them were ten years ago. Parents always show their love to their children by sending them to expensive schools, taking them on holidays to different countries, and buying expensive things for them. It is time to add this all-important gift to this list and rest assured that their future is secured.
                
                Considering the rate of capital value appreciation of our derivatives, parents can rest assured that before their child, who is in primary school today, graduates from the university, they will be worth several million. The Young Landlord Scheme is a must for every caring parent because the future of their child should be a priority.
                
                Furthermore, the Young Landlord Scheme not only provides a financial benefit for the child’s future, but it also instills a sense of responsibility and ownership in them. By owning a piece of property, the child learns the value of hard work and investment, and the importance of taking care of something that belongs to them. This sense of responsibility and ownership can carry over into other aspects of their lives, such as their education and career.
                
                Additionally, the Young Landlord Scheme also provides a sense of security for the child’s future. The property they own will always be there as a safety net, providing them with a source of income or a place to call home. This can provide peace of mind for both the child and the parents, knowing that their child’s future is secure.
                
                The Young Landlord Scheme also provides an opportunity for parents to bond with their children and share in a common goal. The process of buying and taking care of a piece of property can be a fun and exciting experience for both parent and child. It can also serve as a way for parents to teach their children about money management and investment.
                
                It is important to note that the Young Landlord Scheme is not just for parents who can afford to buy a large piece of property. The scheme offers options for smaller plots of land and flexible payment plans, making it accessible for a wider range of parents. This allows parents from all backgrounds to invest in their child’s future and give them the opportunity to become a smart landlord.
                
                Another advantage of the Young Landlord Scheme is the potential for rental income. As the child grows older, they can choose to rent out the property and earn a steady stream of income. This can help them with their education or other expenses, and give them a sense of financial independence.
                
                The Young Landlord Scheme is also an opportunity for parents to invest in their child’s future in a way that is not dependent on the stock market or other volatile investments. The value of land is more stable and predictable, making it a more secure investment for parents.
                
                In addition, the Young Landlord Scheme is not just limited to children. It is also open to young adults who are looking to invest in their own future. This allows young people to start building their wealth and securing their future at an early age.
                
                Lastly, participating in this scheme also gives the child or young adult, the opportunity to start building their credit history. This can help them with future purchases like cars and homes, and make it easier for them to get loans and credit.
